                <p class="mb-4">
                    The Maker's Stay began not as a business plan, but as a conviction: that we could build a better way to live. Our founding team, with deep roots in construction, craftsmanship, and community-building, realized that the search for meaning and well-being was leading people back to the land, back to their hands, and back to each other. We saw an opportunity to create a place that honors this return‚Äîa place where regenerative practices, purposeful work, and deep human connection are not just part of the offering, but the very foundation of the community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This vision led us to a powerful conclusion: true regeneration isn't just about the soil; it's about the soul. The Maker's Stay is the physical manifestation of this idea.
