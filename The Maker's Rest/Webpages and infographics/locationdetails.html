                <h1 class="text-5xl font-bold mb-6 text-gray-900">The Strategic Case for Michigan's Upper Peninsula</h1>

                <div class="prose lg:prose-xl max-w-none">
                    <p>The selection of our 212-acre property in Michigan's Upper Peninsula is a strategic, data-driven decision, not a choice of convenience. The location offers a perfect convergence of natural resources, a thriving "maker" culture, and a supportive regulatory environment, making it an ideal foundation for a resilient and profitable venture. The analysis demonstrates that this location, far from being a liability, is a top-performing and robust market, making it a highly compelling and strategically sound choice.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">Market Dominance & Economic Strength</h2>
                    <p>Michigan's tourism industry is a powerhouse, generating over $28 billion annually. The Upper Peninsula is a premier destination within this market, experiencing a significant 7.7% increase in visitor spending in 2023 alone. This demonstrates a thriving and growing regional market that is hungry for unique, experience-based tourism. Our financial projections, including a first-year net income of $281,163 and a low break-even occupancy rate of 46.9%, are directly supported by this strong market performance.</p>

                    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">Cultural Alignment with the "Maker's Ethos"</h2>
                    <p>The Upper Peninsula boasts a deep-rooted culture of craftsmanship, self-reliance, and outdoor recreation. This is not a culture we need to create, but one we can tap into directly. The creative sector in the region is a significant economic driver, generating over $42.5 million in 2022. This indicates a pre-existing, built-in audience and talent pool that aligns perfectly with our "Maker's Ethos," providing a strong foundation for community integration and partnerships.</p>
                    
                    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">A Supportive Regulatory and Business Environment</h2>
                    <p>Michigan offers a stable and supportive regulatory landscape for a venture like The Maker's Stay. The state has specific laws that support and protect agritourism businesses, such as the Michigan Right to Farm Act. Furthermore, programs like the Farmland and Open Space Preservation Program provide long-term financial advantages and protections. This clear legal framework de-risks the development process and provides a stable foundation for long-term growth and security.</p>
