                <div class="prose lg:prose-xl max-w-none">
                    <p>The Maker's Stay is engineered from the ground up to withstand systemic shocks. Our multi-layered legal, financial, and operational frameworks insulate the project from the vulnerabilities that could cripple conventional enterprises. This is not an accident; it is a deliberate strategy to build a long-term, sustainable community asset.</p>

                     <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mt-12 mb-4">Legal Resilience: The Maker's Trust</h2>
                     <p>The cornerstone of our model is a hybrid legal structure, The Maker's Trust, which functions similarly to a Community Land Trust (CLT). In this model, the Trust retains ownership of the land in perpetuity, while residents and businesses hold long-term, inheritable leases. This structure fundamentally disconnects the value of the land from the speculative real estate market, providing a powerful layer of security against market downturns and gentrification.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Defining the Community Land Trust (CLT) Model</h3>
                        <p>For those unfamiliar with the structure, a Community Land Trust is a nonprofit, community-based organization designed to ensure permanent community stewardship of land. Hereâ€™s how it works:</p>
                        <ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-4 space-y-2">
                            <li><strong>Dual Ownership Structure:</strong> The CLT acquires land and holds it in trust for the benefit of the community forever. It then sells or leases the buildings on that land (like homes and businesses) to residents at affordable prices.</li>
                            <li><strong>Long-Term Leases:</strong> An individual or family who buys a home on CLT land enters into a long-term, inheritable ground lease with the trust, typically for 99 years. This lease grants them exclusive use of the land and full ownership of their home.</li>
                            <li><strong>Preserving Affordability:</strong> The ground lease includes a resale formula that determines the home's sale price in the future. This allows homeowners to earn a fair, but limited, amount of equity upon selling, while ensuring the home remains affordable for the next income-qualified buyer. This is the key to creating a permanent stock of affordable housing.</li>
                            <li><strong>Community Control:</strong> CLTs are governed by a board often composed of a mix of leaseholders, community members, and public representatives. This democratic structure ensures the organization remains accountable to its mission and the people it serves.</li>
                        </ul>
