                <div class="prose lg:prose-xl max-w-none">
                    <p>Our project is structured into three distinct and sequential phases, representing a total estimated cost of <strong>$5,667,080</strong>. This fiscally responsible approach is designed to de-risk the venture by achieving critical milestones before proceeding to subsequent stages. Capital is deployed strategically and efficiently, with each phase building upon the tangible assets and successes of the last.</p>
